INTERPRETATION:
This patient exercised for 10 minutes and 40 seconds on a cycle ergometer
using a 10 watt ramping protocol. He achieved a workload of 104 watts (54%
predicted).  Exercise was stopped due to leg fatigue.  No chest pain was
reported.  No wheezing was auscultated immediately post exercise.  The
study was submaximal.  Maximum VO2 (l/min) was 84% of predicted value
consistent with normal absolute oxygen consumption.  Exercise capacity
relative to body weight was also normal at 21.2 ml/kg/min (88% predicted).


The baseline electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with an
incomplete right bundle branch block pattern and nonspecific ST-T wave
abnormalities.  Occasional premature ventricular contractions were
observed.  Non-diagnostic ECG portion of the exercise stress test due to
failure to reach target heart rate.

The peak O2 pulse, reflecting stroke volume, is above normal with an
appropriate curvilinear response with exercise.  The heart rate response to
exercise is linear but the slope is shifted downward (blunted at each
exercise stage).  There is abundant heart rate reserve at peak exercise
which may be due to beta-adrenergic blockade and/or antiarrhythmic therapy.
The blood pressure response with exercise is appropriate.  The onset of
anaerobic threshold is delayed.  Together these findings suggest a blunted
heart rate response with an otherwise normal cardiovascular response to
submaximal exercise.  The expected cardiovascular limitation to maximal
exercise is not demonstrated.  The delayed onset of anaerobic threshold
suggests good cardiovascular conditioning.  The O2 pulse may be falsely
elevated in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade and/or antiarrhythmic
therapy.

The breathing reserve is normal with no ventilatory limitation to further
exercise.  However, the exercise flow volume loops demonstrate expiratory
flow limitation; although not preventing further with exercise.  The RR at
peak exercise is normal; the VT at peak exercise is 42% of the FVC.
Measured dead space is normal at rest.  Ventilatory equivalents for CO2 and
O2 at anaerobic threshold are normal.  The resting arterial blood gas is
normal.  There was no oxygen desaturation with exercise.  Together these
findings are suggestive of no ventilatory limitation or gas exchange
abnormalities with submaximal exercise. These findings are consistent with
the resting PFTs.

To summarize, these results indicate that the patient's exercise tolerance
is normal with reduced estimated work efficiency (external workload of 54%
at 84% VO2).  This study demonstrates a blunted heart rate response with
evidence of good cardiovascular conditioning.  The expected cardiovascular
limitation with maximal exercise is not demonstrated; although may be
masked in the presence of beta-adrenergic blockade and/or antiarrhythmic
therapy.  Despite the expiratory flow limitation demonstrated on the
exercise flow volume loops, there is no evidence of ventilatory limitation
or ventilation/perfusion mismatching preventing further exercise.
Recommend 1) further pulmonary evaluation and 2) a continued
exercise-training program with a target heart rate of 66-72 bpm and a
Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 2-3 on a scale of 1-10, exercising
3-5 times per week for 20-30 minutes.
