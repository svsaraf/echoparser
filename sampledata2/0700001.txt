INTERPRETATION:
This patient exercised for 7 minutes and 56 seconds on a treadmill using a
Modified Bruce protocol. He achieved a speed of 1.7 mph and an elevation of
105.  Exercise was stopped due to mouthpiece discomfort.  No chest pain was
reported.  No wheezing was auscultated immediately post exercise.  The
study was submaximal.  Maximum VO2 (l/min) was 70% of predicted value
consistent with mildly reduced absolute oxygen consumption.  However,
exercise capacity relative to body weight was moderately reduced at 15.3
ml/kg/min (61% predicted).  Compared with CPET done on 09/29/2006, exercise
capacity has improved.  Previous peak VO2 was 13.0 ml/kg/min (1.118 L/min)
and exercise time was 6:53 on the Modified Bruce protocol.

Baseline ventricular paced rhythm with intermittent atrial fibrillation and
intermittent native beats noted during exercise.  No definite premature
ventricular beats were observed.  Non-diagnostic ECG portion of the
exercise stress test due to paced rhythm.

The peak O2 pulse, reflecting stroke volume, is normal with a flattened
curvilinear response with exercise. This abnormal response indicates a
reduced stroke volume at a maximal a-v O2 difference.  The heart rate
response to exercise demonstrates a normal linear slope until end exercise
when the slope accelerates.  There is abundant heart rate reserve at peak
exercise which may be due to lack of pacemaker rate responsiveness.  The
blood pressure response with exercise is appropriate.  The onset of
anaerobic threshold is delayed.  Together these findings suggest an
abnormal cardiovascular response to submaximal exercise.  The normal
cardiovascular limitation to maximal exercise is not demonstrated.

The breathing reserve is normal consistent with no ventilatory limitation
to further exercise.  Exercise flow volume loops demonstrate expiratory
flow limitation with exercise; although not preventing further exercise.
The RR at peak exercise is normal; the VT at peak exercise is 39% of the
FVC.  Ventilatory equivalents for CO2 and O2 at anaerobic threshold are
high.  This is suggestive of ventilation/perfusion mismatching.  There was
no oxygen desaturation with exercise.  Together these findings are
suggestive of no ventilatory limitation with submaximal exercise. These
findings are consistent with the resting PFTs.

To summarize, these results indicate that the patient's exercise tolerance
is moderately reduced despite mildly reduced absolute oxygen consumption.
Estimated work efficiency is reduced.  This study demonstrates an abnormal
cardiovascular response; specifically an inability to augment stroke volume
in conjunction with an accelerated heart rate response with exercise.  The
normal cardiovascular limitation with maximal exercise is not demonstrated;
although may be masked with the lack of significant pacemaker rate
responsiveness.  There is evidence of expiratory flow limitation with
exercise; however this is not preventing further exercise.  There is
evidence of gas exchange abnormalities with exercise.  Compared to recent
cardiopulmonary testing, both exercise duration and oxygen consumption have
improved.
